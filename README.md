📘 Description

Todo Weblist is a simple yet functional task-management web application built using Flask, Python, HTML, and CSS.
This project represents my journey as a complete beginner in programming, with CS50 being the first course that introduced me to coding. Everything I have implemented here is based on concepts I learned directly from the CS50 lectures, especially the Flask and web track.

This web app allows users to create a personalized list of tasks and manage them easily through an intuitive interface. The purpose of the project is not just to create a to-do list but to demonstrate my understanding of web development, routing, templates, handling user input, and connecting backend logic with frontend pages.

Even though this is a beginner project, it reflects my sincerity, honesty, and dedication toward learning programming from scratch. I built this using the exact foundational tools taught in CS50, without using any advanced frameworks or AI-generated code. Every function, route, and HTML structure is something I wrote by manually practicing what I learned.

🧠 What This Project Demonstrates

✔ Flask routing and backend logic

I implemented multiple routes such as the homepage and task submission route. These routes handle form submissions, add tasks to a list, and render pages using Flask’s templating engine.

✔ Jinja templating

I learned how Flask passes data to HTML pages and how to loop through lists to display tasks dynamically.

✔ HTML structure

I built a clean and structured HTML page that displays the tasks and includes simple forms to add or delete tasks.

✔ Basic CSS styling

I applied simple styling to make the app more readable and visually neat, keeping things beginner-friendly.

✔ Handling user input

The project handles adding tasks and displays them instantly without needing advanced features like databases.

📌 Future Improvements (TODO)

These are the features I plan to add in the future as my coding skills grow:

Add a SQLite database so tasks remain saved even after restarting the server

Add a feature to edit existing tasks

Add user accounts and login system

Add dark mode

Add improved and responsive CSS design

Add categories, deadlines, and priority levels

❤️ Why This Project Matters

This project is special to me because:

CS50 is the first programming course of my life

This project is the first real web application I ever built

I learned every single concept step by step

It reflects my hard work, honesty, and growth


This project marks the beginning of my computer science journey, and completing it for CS50 is an achievement I am proud
